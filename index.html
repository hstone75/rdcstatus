						<span class="title">Power outage - Major grid failure</span>
						<p>Power to all buildings disrupted by a major grid failure affecting all of Puerto Rico since 3 PM. Authorities are working to resolve this outage, and most areas of the island are expected to have power restored by tomorrow morning. Further information will be posted here as it is received.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-09-22 14:11:02 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Power to R&amp;DC buildings is still not restored. Work crews are gradually restoring power across the island. Best-case estimates from government officials expect 50% of the grid to be back up by 2 PM Thursday, with all services restored by Friday morning.</p>
